## Interactive Learning Modules

Visual, slide-based learning modules following the same pattern as the [MLOPS System Design](https://github.com/ashokmulchandani/MLOPS-End-End-Prediction-Pipeline-Ashok-1) project. Each module has keyboard navigation (← →), quizzes, dark/light themes, and code walkthroughs.

## Chat Context & Revision Notes

### Session: 2026-07-21 (Initial Review)

**What Was Reviewed:**
- Full directory structure of `CUDA_Projects-Ashok/` — 7 Colab notebooks, 2 Python scripts, Triton demo, 3D recon reference, LiDAR datasets reference, 3.6 GB local LiDAR data
- Cross-referenced with 3 sibling repos: `Chicken-Disease-Classification-Projects/` (TF VGG16 + DVC pipeline), `Ashok-Disease_Chicken_Deep_Learning_Classification/` (raw dataset), `Fine_tuning-ML-Pipleine--Synthetic_Data-Ashok-1/` (Phase 10 spinoff, 10-phase fine-tuning plan)
- Compared plan structure with `MLOPS_System_Design_Thinking/` project for HTML learning module patterns

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Ordering is broken** — Phases 6, 7, 9 completed before Phase 5. The 32-session execution table is frozen in time.
2. **Phase 5 (VGG16 in CUDA) is partially redundant** — user already wrote CNN kernels (Phase 3.5), deployed TensorRT/Triton (Phase 6), and has a working TF VGG16 chicken disease classifier with DVC in another repo.
3. **Phase 8 (Transformer) only has a stub notebook** — the most important remaining topic needs a full breakdown.
4. **No multi-GPU programming** — NCCL, data/model parallelism, all-reduce are missing.
5. **All code lives in notebooks** — the `src/` directory structure in the plan was never populated. No CMake/Makefile build system.
6. **Phase 10** moved to a separate fine-tuning repo — noted for cross-reference.

### Session: 2026-07-22 — Interactive HTMLs Built

All interactive modules follow the MLOPS System Design project pattern: single-file HTML, Orbitron + JetBrains Mono + DM Sans fonts, dark/light theme toggle (persisted in localStorage), animated particle background (canvas), keyboard navigation (← →), clickable progress dots & topic chips, quizzes with correct/wrong feedback on every slide.

All linked in CUDA_PLAN.md (Phase sections + Interactive Learning Modules table) and README.md.

### Recommended Next Revisions
- **Phase 5** → Replace "VGG16 from scratch" with "Applied MLOps Bridge": take existing TF chicken disease model → TensorRT → Triton → CI/CD
- **Phase 8** → Expand into 3 sub-phases: 8A (Self-attention + multi-head kernels), 8B (GPT-style decoder + KV-Cache), 8C (Flash Attention + FP16 optimization)
- **Add Phase 11** → Multi-GPU Programming: NCCL, data parallelism, model parallelism, all-reduce
- **Add build system** — CMakeLists.txt for all CUDA source files, moving from notebook `%%writefile` to proper `.cu` files
- **Drop the frozen 32-session table** — replace with a "Current Status" table reflecting actual completion order
- **Enable GitHub Pages** on the CUDA repo for live HTML hosting (same as MLOPS repo setup)
